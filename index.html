        <h2>
          Sánchez likely to remain in power after stalemate in Spanish elections

          Spain is in limbo with both left and right claiming victory in
          yesterday’s elections despite predictions that the right would win an
          outright majority. Both President Pedro Sánchez of the Socialist
          Workers’ Party (PSOE) and his rival Alberto Núñez Feijóo of the
          conservative Popular Party (PP) have been pictured raising their fists
          to adoring crowds claiming victory. Yet both of them lack a clear
          route to power. Feijóo’s PP performed well, up to 136 seats from 89 in
          2019 but some distance short of the 176 seats needed to form a
          government. Prior to the election, many thought Feijóo would turn to
          Santiago Abascal’s hard-right Vox party to form a coalition –
          resulting in the return of Spain’s far-right to government for the
          first time since Franco. But Vox had a terrible night at the polls and
          performed much worse than expected. The party lost more than a third
          of its seats, meaning its 33 seats would not be enough to grant Feijóo
          the power to form a coalition.

          Tomorrow’s by-elections arrive just ahead of next week’s parliamentary
          recess and it is quite clear that we are in silly season. The term was
          originally coined in an article called “The Silly Season” in the
          Victorian London weekly, The Saturday Review, on 13 July 1861. The
          idea was that as the respected parliamentarians and hacks took their
          late-summer holidays, the mantle was taken up by rookies. The article
          claims: “The hands which at other times wield the pen for our
          instruction are now wielding the gun on a Scotch moor or the
          Alpenstock on a Swiss mountain. Work is left to feebler hands…In those
          months the great oracle becomes – what at other times it is not –
          simply silly.”

        <h2>Former permanent secretary paid £335k severance</h2>
        <div class="container">

        <p class="article">
          On the day of the all-important by-elections, the last thing the
          Tories need is more accusations of sleaze. Unfortunately, figures from
          the Treasury’s annual accounts surrounding severance pay-outs will do
          just that. The Sun has reported that the former permanent secretary to
          the Treasury, Sir Tom Scholar, was paid a whopping £335,000 severance
          payment after being sacked by Liz Truss when she became prime
          minister. Scholar was also paid £122,000 in compensation and annual
          leave adjustments in lieu of notice, which brought his total annual
          payments up to around £550,000 for the year 2022-23.
